# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Project Overview

In this module we created a geographical map with GeoJSON data from multiple sources using the Leaflet.js API. The map shows all earthquakes within a 7 day period and are visually represented by a circle and color. Additionally each marker on the map has a pop up that will tell you the location and magnitude of the earthquake it represents. Lastly, the map can be filted with 3 different settings. These filters can change the style of the map and will filter through the data shown i.e. earthquakes, major earthquakes, and tectonic plates.
